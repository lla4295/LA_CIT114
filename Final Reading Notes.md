# Final Reading Notes
## Cloud Concepts Overview
### 1. Summarize a few key points made in the readings or videos.
- The cloud refers to a distinct IT environment that is designed for the purpose of remotely provisioning scalable and measured IT resources.
##### Business drivers of cloud computing include... 
1. **Capacity Planning**
- Planning for determination and furfillment of an organization's future IT demands, resources products/services made easier.
2. **Cost Reduction**
- Cost of buying infrastructure & maintaining it is cheaper.
3. **Organizational Agility**
- Businesses/organizations can adapt to change easier.
##### Cloud computing models include...
1. **SAAS (Software as a Service)**
- Allows users to connect & use cloud-based apps over the internet.
- Resources Include: Application Software.
- Used by end users/customers.
- Ex: Gmail, Google Docs, Google Drive, Office 365, HR/Helpdesk Solutions, and Salesforce.
2. **PAAS (Platform as a Service)**
- A development/deployment environment in the cloud.
- Resources Include: Programming Language Execution Environment, An Operating System, A Web Server, and a Database.
- Used by developers.
- Ex: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine, Windows Azure, Heroku, and Force.com.
3. **IAAS (Infrastructure as a Service)**
- An instant computing infrastructure, that can be provisoned and managed over the internet.
- Resources Include: Data Storage, Virtualization, Servers & Networking.
- Used by sysadmins.
- Ex: Amazon EC2, GoGrid, and Rackspace.com.
## Cloud Economics and Billing
- AWS offers on-demand, pay-as-you-go, and reservation-based payment models, enabling you to obtain the best return on your investment for each specific use case.
- AWS is typically cheaper than on-premise data centers because you only pay for the services you consume w/ no large upfront costs. (Variable costs eliminated/lowered)
- You can save on AWS when you invest reserved capacity/instances (up to 75%), there are three types.
- All Upfront Reserved Instance (AURI) - 32% Savings
- Partial Upfront Reserved Instance (PURI)- 42% Savings
- No Upfront Reserved Instance (NURI)- 43% Savings
- You can also save on AWS when you use more resources and services because of volume-based discounts. (The more you use, the less you pay per GB.)
### Three Fundamental Drivers Of Pricing
- Compute
- Storage
- Outbound Data Transfer
### Pricing Models Include...
- On Demand - Paying for compute or database capacity wo/ long term commitments or upfront payments.
- Dedicated Instances - Amazon EC2; Virtual Private Clouds that run on hardware that is dedicated to a single customer.
- Spot Instances - Amazon EC2 Pricing Mechanism that let you purchase discounted spare computing capacity w/o upfront commitment. 
- Reservations - Paying for capacity ahead of time; allows you to save up to 75%.
### Other Notes...
- Rio Hondo is partnered w/ Amazon Educate, so students have benefits in AWS.
- The AWS free tier allows you to test-drive some AWS services free-of-charge.
- IT infrastructure consists of hardware, software, and networking; there are two types which are traditional and cloud.
- TCO stands for total cost of ownership, this is a formula calculates direct and indirect costs and benefits related to the purchase of any IT component. 
- The goal of TCO is to project a final figure that will reflect the true purchase price with everything considered.
- AWS has budgets and cost/usage reporting to help you keep track of your billing.
- AWS has different support plans that provide customer service benefits at different costs.
