# Notes 01: Cloud Concept Overview
### 1. Summarize a few key points made in the readings or videos.
- The cloud refers to a distinct IT environment that is designed for the purpose of remotely provisioning scalable and measured IT resources.
##### Business drivers of cloud computing include... 
1. **Capacity Planning**
- Planning for determination and furfillment of an organization's future IT demands, resources products/services made easier.
2. **Cost Reduction**
- Cost of buying infrastructure & maintaining it is cheaper.
3. **Organizational Agility**
- Businesses/organizations can adapt to change easier.
##### Cloud computing models include...
1. **SAAS (Software as a Service)**
- Allows users to connect & use cloud-based apps over the internet.
- Resources Include: Application Software.
- Used by end users/customers.
- Ex: Gmail, Google Docs, Google Drive, Office 365, HR/Helpdesk Solutions, and Salesforce.
2. **PAAS (Platform as a Service)**
- A development/deployment environment in the cloud.
- Resources Include: Programming Language Execution Environment, An Operating System, A Web Server, and a Database.
- Used by developers.
- Ex: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine, Windows Azure, Heroku, and Force.com.
3. **IAAS (Infrastructure as a Service)**
- An instant computing infrastructure, that can be provisoned and managed over the internet.
- Resources Include: Data Storage, Virtualization, Servers & Networking.
- Used by sysadmins.
- Ex: Amazon EC2, GoGrid, and Rackspace.com.

#### 2. Identify and provide two quotes that were made in the readings or videos, that you found interesting. Describe why you found each quote of them interesting.
> Cloud computing is a specialized form of distributed computing that introduces utilization models for remotely provisioning scalable and measured resources.
> - Forrester Research (2.1)
- I found this quote interesting because it gave a concise definition of cloud computing & defines what it does for companies. This quote makes me curious about what utilization models it introduces.
> It can be difﬁcult to establish a security architecture that spans such a trust boundary without introducing vulnerabilities, unless cloud consumers and cloud providers happen to support the same or compatible security frameworks - which is unlikely with public clouds. (2.5 Risks and Challenges)
> - I found this quote interesting because it states that security increased security vulnerabilities is a disadvantage of cloud computing. This makes me curious about cloud security.
#### 3. Outline the new facts that you learned from this section?
- Learned the definition of the "cloud".
- Learned the 3 busineses drivers of cloud computing.
- Learned about the 3 cloud computing models, what they stand for, and what they do/provide for specific groups of people.
#### 4. What questions remain in your mind after reading this section?
- What are some careers in cloud computing?
- What are the costs of cloud computing vs on-premise in an organization/company?
