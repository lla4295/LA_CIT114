# Notes 02: Cloud Economics and Billing
##### 1. Summarize a few key points made in the readings or videos.
- AWS offers on-demand, pay-as-you-go, and reservation-based payment models, enabling you to obtain the best return on your investment for each specific use case.
- AWS is typically cheaper than on-premise data centers because you only pay for the services you consume w/ no large upfront costs. (Variable costs eliminated/lowered)
- You can save on AWS when you invest reserved capacity/instances (up to 75%), there are three types.
- All Upfront Reserved Instance (AURI) - 32% Savings
- Partial Upfront Reserved Instance (PURI)- 42% Savings
- No Upfront Reserved Instance (NURI)- 43% Savings
- You can also save on AWS when you use more resources and services because of volume-based discounts. (The more you use, the less you pay per GB.)
## Three Fundamental Drivers Of Pricing
- Compute
- Storage
- Outbound Data Transfer
## Pricing Models Include...
- On Demand - Paying for compute or database capacity wo/ long term commitments or upfront payments.
- Dedicated Instances - Amazon EC2; Virtual Private Clouds that run on hardware that is dedicated to a single customer.
- Spot Instances - Amazon EC2 Pricing Mechanism that let you purchase discounted spare computing capacity w/o upfront commitment. 
- Reservations - Paying for capacity ahead of time; allows you to save up to 75%.
## Other Notes...
- Rio Hondo is partnered w/ Amazon Educate, so students have benefits in AWS.
- The AWS free tier allows you to test-drive some AWS services free-of-charge.
- IT infrastructure consists of hardware, software, and networking; there are two types which are traditional and cloud.
- TCO stands for total cost of ownership, this is a formula calculates direct and indirect costs and benefits related to the purchase of any IT component. 
- The goal of TCO is to project a final figure that will reflect the true purchase price with everything considered.
- AWS has budgets and cost/usage reporting to help you keep track of your billing.
- AWS has different support plans that provide customer service benefits at different costs.
