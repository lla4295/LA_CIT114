# Notes 03: Cloud Global Infrastructure
#### 1. Summarize a few key points made in the readings or videos.
- AWS has infrastructure all over the world; this allows you to go global in minutes.
- AWS regions are seperate geographic area that AWS uses to house its infrastructure. (Distributed around the world so customers can choose closest location.)
- AWS availability zones are building blocks that make up AWS regions. (AZ's are isolated data center locations within a region.)
- It is recommended to distribute instances over multiple availability zones so if one fails, you have a backup.
- AWS infrastructure is elastic, scalable, fault-tolerant, and highly available.
- AWS serves 245 countries/territories in total, it has 27 launched regions, 87 Availability Zones (AZ's), and 410 points of presence. 
- AWS regions include: North America, South America, Europe, Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific, and Australia.
## Factors to consider when choosing AWS region (Best for workload)
- Supported AWS services - Some AWS services are not available in all regions.
- Cost - Differs based on region.
- Latency - Should be blazing fast, should be picked based on target audience location.
- Security & Compliance - Abide by each countries Data Security and Compliance rules.
- Service Level Agreements - Not all AWS services warrant the same SLA.
