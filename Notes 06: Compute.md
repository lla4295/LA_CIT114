# Notes 06: Compute
## 1. Summarize a few key points made in the readings or videos.
- AWS offers a variety of compute services, the four broad categories consist of Virtual Machines, Containers, Serverless, and Platform as a Service.
### Compute Service Categories
- Virtual Machines - Lets you obtain and configure capacity with ease, control computing resources, run on Amazon's proven computing environment, build IAAS applications for instance-based VM's, and provison machines & manage as you choose. Ex:) Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
- Serverless - Allows you to run code w/o provisioning or managing servers; you only pay for compute time consumed, no charge while code isn't running. Ex:) AWS Lambda.
- Containers - Enable you to run workloads on a single operating-system, these spin up more quickly than VM's so they offer more responsiveness. Ex.) Amazon Elastic Container Service, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service, AWS Fargate, and Amazon Elastic Container Registry.
- PAAS (Platform As A Service) - Allows a company to focus on building code and applications rather than the management of infrastructure. Ex:) AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
