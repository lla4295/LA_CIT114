# Notes 06: Compute
## 1. Summarize a few key points made in the readings or videos.
- AWS offers a variety of compute services, the four broad categories consist of Virtual Machines, Containers, Serverless, and Platform as a Service.
### Compute Service Categories
- Virtual Machines - Lets you obtain and configure capacity with ease, control computing resources, run on Amazon's proven computing environment, build IAAS applications for instance-based VM's, and provison machines & manage as you choose. Ex:) Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
- Serverless - Allows you to run code w/o provisioning or managing servers; you only pay for compute time consumed, no charge while code isn't running. Ex:) AWS Lambda.
- Containers - Enable you to run workloads on a single operating-system, these spin up more quickly than VM's so they offer more responsiveness. Ex.) Amazon Elastic Container Service, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service, AWS Fargate, and Amazon Elastic Container Registry.
- PAAS (Platform As A Service) - Allows a company to focus on building code and applications rather than the management of infrastructure. Ex:) AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
### Practices For Selection Of Compute Resources
- Evaluation of available compute options.
- Understanding of available compute configuration options.
- Collecting compute-related metrics.
- Determination of required configuration by right-sizing.
- Using of available elasticity of resources.
- Re-evaluation of compute needs based on metrics.
### VM's (Virtual Machines)
- A software-based computer that exists within another computer’s operating system.
- VM's run off hypervisors, or pieces of software/hardware.
- Testing - Software Developers want to test their code in different environments; they use VM's to furfill this need.
- Running software designed for other OSes - VM's can run software designed for other OSes.
- Running outdated software - VM's can run old versions of OSes.
- Cloud Computing uses VM's for running SAAS applications, Backing up data, and Hosting services like email and access management.
- Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides virtual machines where you can host the same kinds of applications that you might run on a traditional on-premises server.
### Four Pillars of Cost Optimization
- Pillar 1. Right Size - Choose right balance of instance types & provision matches to your need.
- Pillar 2. Increase elasticity - Use automatic scaling to reduce costs by turning off resources when not needed.
- Pillar 3. Leverage the right pricing model - Choose right pricing model to optimize based on workload/usage patterns.
- Pillar 4. Optimize storage - Optimize storage use to reduce storage costs.
### Containers
- Containers are an approach to operating system virtualization
- Users can work with a program and its dependencies using resource procedures that are isolated.
- Used to build blocks, which help in producing operational efficiency, version control, developer productivity and environmental consistency.
- Benefits include: The Consistency in Cloud Storage, Application Version Control, Efficiency in the Operational Activities, and Productivity of the Developers.
- Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) are container services.
### Serverless Computing
- Method of providing backend services on a as-used basis.
- Servers are still used but company gets backend services from a serverless vendor and is charged based on usage.
- Allows users to write and deploy code without worrying about existing infrastructure. 
- AWS Lambda is a container service.
### Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Removes the need for organizations to manage the underlying infrastructure.
- Allows you to focus on the deployment and management of your applications.
- Increases efficiency becuase you don’t need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or any of the other undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running your application.
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a PaaS service.
## 2. Identify and provide two quotes that were made in the readings or videos, that you found interesting. Describe why you found each quote of them interesting.
> "Then, they’d carry it to a room containing a room-sized computer, and hand it to a dedicated computer operator. That person would then feed the program into the computer when it was next available." (Crash Course Operating Systems)
- I found this quote interesting because it described how programs were run in the past before opearting systems, and this suprised me because it sounded very inefficient and complicated.
> "An operating system is the most important software that runs on a computer. It manages the computer's memory and processes, as well as all of its software and hardware." (8.01 What is an Operating System?)
- I found this quote interesting because it made me realize how important an operating system is to a computer because it manages the core of it, software and hardware. Without an OS, a computer is useless.
## 3. Outline the new facts that you learned from this section?

- Which compute categories or services are the most used in AWS?
- Which specific services are most used in AWS?
