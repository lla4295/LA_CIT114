# Notes 06: Compute
## 1. Summarize a few key points made in the readings or videos.
- AWS offers a variety of compute services, the four broad categories consist of Virtual Machines, Containers, Serverless, and Platform as a Service.
### Compute Service Categories
- Virtual Machines - Lets you obtain and configure capacity with ease, control computing resources, run on Amazon's proven computing environment, build IAAS applications for instance-based VM's, and provison machines & manage as you choose. Ex:) Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
- Serverless - Allows you to run code w/o provisioning or managing servers; you only pay for compute time consumed, no charge while code isn't running. Ex:) AWS Lambda.
- Containers - Enable you to run workloads on a single operating-system, these spin up more quickly than VM's so they offer more responsiveness. Ex.) Amazon Elastic Container Service, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service, AWS Fargate, and Amazon Elastic Container Registry.
- PAAS (Platform As A Service) - Allows a company to focus on building code and applications rather than the management of infrastructure. Ex:) AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
### Practices For Selection Of Compute Resources
- Evaluation of available compute options.
- Understanding of available compute configuration options.
- Collecting compute-related metrics.
- Determination of required configuration by right-sizing.
- Using of available elasticity of resources.
- Re-evaluation of compute needs based on metrics.
### VM's (Virtual Machines)
- A software-based computer that exists within another computerâ€™s operating system.
- VM's run off hypervisors, or pieces of software/hardware.
- Testing - Software Developers want to test their code in different environments; they use VM's to furfill this need.
- Running software designed for other OSes - VM's can run software designed for other OSes.
- Running outdated software - VM's can run old versions of OSes.
- Cloud Computing uses VM's for running SAAS applications, Backing up data, and Hosting services like email and access management.
- Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides virtual machines where you can host the same kinds of applications that you might run on a traditional on-premises server.
