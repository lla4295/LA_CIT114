# Notes 08: Databases
## 1. Summarize a few key points made in the readings or videos.
- Databases are shared collections of relational data that is used to support organizations.
- Databases typically contain many tables with data stored inside of them.
- A DBMS or Database Management System is a group of programs that allow for the easy creation, maintenence, and control of databases.
- Databases consist of relations, tables, columns, domains, records and degrees.
- There are two types of databases relational & non-relational (document oriented, graph based, key-value, etc.)
- SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, AND DELETE are basic SQL Query Commands.
- The difference between unmanaged and managed services are that scaling, fault tolerance, and availibility are managed by the user in unmananged while in managed it's built into the service.
### Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)
- Managed relational database service that provides you with six database engines to choose from. 
- (Amazon Aurora, MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and PostgreSQL are the six DB engines provided by AWS RDS.
- A DB instance is the most basic building block of Amazon RDS, it contains user-created databases.
- You can choose the DB Engine, computation and memory capactity, and storage or DB instances.
- You can run DB Instances with Amazon VPC so that you can have control over it's networking environment.
- On demand instances or reserved instances pricing options.
### Amazon DynamoDB
- Fully managed key-value and document NoSQL DB service.
- Provides fast and predictable performance with flexibility.
- NoSQL database with flexibility when storing and organizing data.
- Pricing based on what you read, write, and store in your DynamoDB; optional features also available but cost more.
- On demand or provisioned capacity options.
### Amazon RedShift
- Fully managed, petabyte style scalable data warehouse.
- Consists of clutters that are made up from nodes.
- Integrated with data lakes to manage data.
- Pay for what you use pricing.
### Amazon Aurora
- Relational database that is MySQL and PostgreSQL compatible.
- Faster for cost, Highly available, easy setup, pay as you go pricing.
## 2. Identify and provide two quotes that were made in the readings or videos, that you found interesting. Describe why you found each quote of them interesting.
> "NoSQL can mean “not SQL” or “not only SQL.” As RDBMS have increasingly failed to meet the performance, scalability, and flexibility needs that next-generation, data-intensive applications require, NoSQL databases have been adopted by mainstream enterprises." (10.04 Non-relational Databases)
- I found this quote in the reading interesting because I didn't know what NoSQL was before and this defined it and listed it's uses.
>"SQL is a standard language for selecting, inserting, updating, and deleting data in a relational database. It can do more but the majority of the work in a system is done using SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE."
- I found this quote in the reading interesting because it showed the basic commands of SQL and described what they did exactly partially.
## 3. Outline the new facts that you learned from this section?

- Learned about the basic SQL commands.
- Learned about AWS Database Services, their benefits, pricing.
