# Notes 09: Cloud Architecture
## 1. Summarize a few key points made in the readings or videos.
- In an AWS well-architected framework there are 6 basic pillars.
### 6 Pillars 
- Operational Excellence
- Security
- Reliability
- Performance Efficiency
- Cost Optimization
- Sustainibility
### Operational Excellence
- Ability to support development + run workloads efficiently.
- Ability to gain insight into operations & keep improving supporting processes to improve efficiency & deliver business value.
- 4 practice areas for operational excellence in the cloud are organization, prepare, operate, and evolve.
### Security
- Ability to protect your data, systems, and assets.
- Ability to take advantage of cloud assets to improve security.
- 6 practice areas for security in the cloud are Security, Identity and Access Management, Detection, Infrastructure Protection, Data Protection andIncident Response.
### Reliability 
- Ability of a workload to perform it's intended function correctly + consistently when needed.
- Ability to test + operate workload through it's lifecycle.
- 4 practice areas for reliability in the cloud are foundations, workload architecture, change management, and failure management.
### Performance Efficiency
- Ability to use computing resources efficiently & meet system requirements.
- Ability to maintain efficiency as demand changes and technology evolves.
- 4 practice areas for Performance Efficiency in the cloud are selection, review, monitoring, and tradeoffs.
### Cost Optimization 
- Ability to deliver operations at business value at the lowest possible price.
- 5 practice areas for Cost Optimization in the cloud are Practice Cloud Financial Management, Expenditure and usage awareness, Cost-effective resources, Manage demand and supply resources, and Optimize over time.
### Sustainibility
- Ability for architecture to stay environmentally sustainable.
- 6 practice areas for Sustainibility are Region selection, User behavior patterns, Software and architecture patterns, Data patterns, Hardware patterns, Development and deployment process.
### Availability
- Period of time when a service is available + time required by system to respond to a user.
- Availability = "Available for Use Time" / "Total Time"
- Fault Tolerance, Scalability, and Recoverability influence this.
- High Availibility is important for good architecture.
### AWS Well-Architectured Tool + Trusted Advisor
- The AWS WA tool reviews your architecture and compares it to the latest AWS architecture and best practices.
- You can use this to improve your architecture.
- AWS Trusted Advisor gives you real time guidance to follow AWS best practices.

## 2. Identify and provide two quotes that were made in the readings or videos, that you found interesting. Describe why you found each quote of them interesting.
> "Everything Fails, all the time." - Werner Vogels, CTO, Amazon.com
- I found this quote interesting because it states that everything fails and it happens all the time. Even though it doesn't I think it is a good saying so that you can be cautious of stuff failing and prep for it.
> "The Sustainability pillar focuses on environmental impacts, especially energy consumption and efficiency,since they are important levers for architects to inform direct action to reduce resource usage." (wellarchitected-framework.2022.pdf).
- I found this quote from the reading interesting because it made me consider environmental impacts of cloud computing. It made me realize that cloud computing is just as environmentally harmful as on-premise because there are still data centers that can negatively impact the environment.
## 3. Outline the new facts that you learned from this section?
- Learned about the 6 pillars of a well architected AWS framework.
- Learned about what each individual pillar consists of and good practices to maintain these pillars.
- Learned about tools you can use to maintain a well architectured AWS framework or create one.
## 4. What questions remain in your mind after reading this section?
- How environmentally harmful is cloud computing, how can we reduce that impact?
