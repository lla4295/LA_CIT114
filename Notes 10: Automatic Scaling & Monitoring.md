# Notes 10: Automatic Scaling & Monitoring
## 1. Summarize a few key points made in the readings or videos.
### Load Balancing
- Practice of distributing computational workloads between two or more computers.
- Typically employed to divide network traffic among several servers.
- Dividing network traffic amongst several servers reduces strain and improves server efficiency.
- Essential for a majority of internet applications to run properly.
- Typically handled by a hardware or software based tool/application called a "load balancer"
### IT monitoring
- The monitoring of IT infrastructure to determine it's performance in real time.
- Real time IT monitoring allows for issues to be found easily and for them to be solved with well-informed decision-making.
### 3 Majors Components of IT Monitoring
- Sensors that generate raw data from network nodes
- Analytics solutions that process this data into information
- UI interfaces that visualize intuitive and insightful reports
### Common Types of IT Monitoring 
- System Monitoring
- Dependency monitoring
- Integration and API monitoring
- Business Activity Monitoring (BAM)
- Web performance monitoring
- Application Performance Monitoring (APM)
- Real User Monitoring (RUM)
- IT monitoring in modern SDLC frameworks
- Security Monitoring
### Autoscaling
- Cloud computing technique that is for dynamically allocating computational resources.
- Enables organizations to scale cloud services such as server capacities or virtual machines up or down automatically, based on defined situations such as traffic ir utilization levels. 
- AWS offers an autoscaling tool Ex: AWS EC2
### AWS Elastic Load Balancing
- Feature that automatically distributes incoming traffic across multiple targets which can be EC2 Instances, Containers, or IP addresses.
### AWS Cloudwatch
- AWS service that monitors your resources and applications in real time.
- Used to track metrics and collect them.
## 2. Identify and provide two quotes that were made in the readings or videos, that you found interesting. Describe why you found each quote of them interesting.
> "Cloud computing providers, such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP), offer autoscaling tools."
- I found this quote in the reading interesting because it listed other services that offered autoscaling tools, it is good to learn about other services than AWS so I can be more knowledgeable.
> "Itâ€™s important to keep an eye on how well the infrastructure performs, since every second of IT downtime or performance lapse can cost businesses millions of dollars in revenue opportunities."
- I found this quote in the reading interesting because it mentioned how downtime can cost businesses severely, it made me realize that IT is very important even though a lot of people are not appreciative of it.
## 3. Outline the new facts that you learned from this section?
- Learned about load balancing & what it was.
- Learned about IT monitoring, it's 3 major components, and common types of it.
- Learned about autoscaling in cloud computing.
- Learned about AWS services that provide load balancing, autoscaling, and monitoring.
